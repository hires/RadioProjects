# Home Station Setup

## Introduction

In the summer of 2022 I was finally able to set up a modest amateur radio
station at my home. I live in a multi-unit condo building and occupy the
main floor and basement on one side of the building. There are six units
with three floors above ground. In May I approached my upstairs neighbour
to see if she would allow me to install several antennas on the roof. She
has access to a roof-top deck via a set of stairs accessible from within
her apartment. She seemed okay with the idea.

I went away and did some research as to what might work. The size and shape
of the building would limit me, but the height above ground level (about 10m)
would offer excellent local coverage and probably decent DX performance on HF
as well. My first plan was to use a dual-band vertical antenna for 2m and 70cm
and a multi-band end-fed wire antenna for 40-10m on HF.

My neighbour didn't like the idea of a wire overhead and asked if I could do
a vertical antenna for HF also. I went away again and came up with a plan to
install two verticals: one for HF and one for VHF/UHF. Below are the details.

## Building

The building was photographed to allow better planning of
placement of antennas and how to run cables neatly down to my
studio which is in the basement at the rear of the building. My
upstairs neighbour who has use of the roof allowed me permission
to install two antennas: one for HF (80-10m) bands and one for
VHF and UHF (2m and 70cm) bands.

## First Antenna Mounting Concept
The original plan was to use a self-supporting antenna base filled
with water. This would not require any screws to be installed in the
structure of the building. Unfortunately the original design called for
an end-fed antenna which was not possible due to a request from my
neighbour to not use wires overhead. Also I learned that bylaws in my
area of the city exempt antennas which consist only of thin vertical
rods. However federal regulations limit the height of an antenna
to 4m due to the existing height of the building. This means that
a short vertical antenna for the HF bands would require some kind of
remote tuner to allow it to work on all bands.

The vertical HF "whip" made it impossible to use the self-supporting
structure due to concerns it might tip over. These parts were scrapped and
partly reused.

## Antenna Coupler and Cables
After realizing the need for a remote way to tune the vertical antenna I
was lucky enough to find an SGC SG-230 antenna coupler (tuner) on the
Canada-wide ham radio swap site. I sent the money to the seller and it
showed up two days later! I did a full check out and inspection on the
bench and it seemed to work properly.

All the cables and wires were prepared. The system requires two coax cables:
one LMR-400 for VHF and UHF to minimize losses, one RG-8X for HF, and a 3-conductor
cable to power up the antenna coupler and also receive status back from it. All cables
are 100' in length to be able to reach from the antenna location, travel under my
neighbour's roof-top deck, and down the side of the building to my studio.

## Mounting Brackets and Antenna Parts
The vertical antenna is composed of a 13' (4m) 1" grey PVC tube with a piece of
scrap LMR-400 up inside as the actual antenna. Due to the PVC material it is probably
longer than 4m electrically. It is possible to directly connect to the antenna without
the coupler simply by disconnecting power to it. There is a bit of extra wire length
required to go from the base of the whip to the top of the antenna coupler. I'm not
sure what effect this will have on the antenna.

The VHF/UHF antenna is a coper J-Pole I built last winter. I had originally installed
it on my first-floor balcony but it had poor performance probably due to buildings
in the way on all sides. Both antennas will be mounted on a home-made wooden bracket
attached to the stairwell which protrudes about 10' from the roof of the building.
The top of the HF whip is only a few feet taller than the high end of the stairwell.

All parts were painted black with exterior enamel paint to protected from weather and
to hide the fact that all the wood is random bits of scrap! Throughout this whole process
my primary goal besides getting on the air was to prepare a professional looking solution
that would look safe and unobtrusive espectially to the non-technical onlooker.

## Installation Day!
My partner helped me and it took from just after 5:45pm until just after 9:00pm to
complete everything. Below are some views of the completed installation.

This is an overall view of the finished installation of the VHF/UHF J-Pole (left) and the
4m vertical HF whip. (right) There will most definitely be coupling between the two antennas,
but I can take care of that inside with some filters, or just terminate the antenna that I am
not currently using.

Here is a close-up view of the J-Pole with a choke in the feedline to prevent RF on the coax shield.
The J-Pole slides down inside a piece of 3/4" grey PVC used as a sleeve to hold it. A screw through the bottom of the PVC pipe acts as a bottom stop to set the height of the J-Pole.

Another view of the J-Pole.

A view of the lower part of the HF system showing the antenna coupler and 4x ground radial wires
going out across the roof to provide a counterpoise. Each wire is around 20-25' long. The HF whip
is supported in a piece of 1.5" black ABS pipe. Some electrical tape was wrapped around the whip
where it fits inside the ABS pipe to make a snug fit so it doesn't rattle around.

Antenna coupler mounted on the mounting bracket. Several ferrite chokes are installed behind the
coupler on the coax and control cables to prevent RF currents traveling back to the radio or
causing RFI problems in the house. Coax connectors are taped up to make them water resistant and
the control cable is spliced with waterproof (gel filled) IDC-type wire splices.

Another view!

Kitty litter pan from the dollar store to cover the coupler. Depite the antenna
coupler being rated for outdoor use the instructions suggest protecting it from
direct sunlight. Hopefully being located under the roof overhang and mounting
brackets will held protect the coupler and connections from rain.

The coax and control cables go under my neighbour's deck and connect to a
piece of 1.5" ABS pipe that I installed on the the side of the building. It was
prepared from below with a "hook" that would hang over the edge of the roof.
The cables tie off securely to the hook and then go down vertically through
the "T" fitting and into the basement stairwell.

Trying to hide the cables a bit by securing them on the side of the pipe.
They shouldn't be visible unless you are on the roof.

![](images/IMG_5744.jpg "Cable Routing")

Here is a view from inside the basement stairwell. Cables exit after travelling
through 36' of ABS pipe mounted on the corner of the building. The wall behind
the pipe is the wall of my studio where the radios will be located.

## Equipment Setup

I made a remote control box for the antenna coupler. It can turn on and off
the power and also has a green LED connected to the "TUNED" line which goes
low when the tuner finds a tune.

I made a little shelf to make reaching the controls a bit easier from my desk.

## Antenna Measurement Results

I swept both antennas on the nanoVNA and checked the results on the station
end of the cables.

<b>I've been using the J-Pole as a receive antenna on all bands with my Airspy
HF+. Here is a sweep of the J-Pole on HF. Surprisingly it does work pretty
well despite the crazy impedance variations.

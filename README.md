# Radio Projects

## Introduction

This repo contains an ongoing journal of radio projects by me: Andrew Kilpatrick
VE2EOT. You might find some of the info useful. If you do, please feel free
to use the info here for your own projects.

I personally find it hard to be interested in things unless there is some sort
of finished result or *product* at the end. Making some DIY stuff for my own
use doesn't really cut it compared with the commercial work I do, since the
quality of a manufactured product is always so superior to what can be made
by hand in spare time. (at least with my physical construction skills)

So documenting these radio projects helps me to keep track of the details of
what I've done, and makes the finished result seem somewhat official, and
hopefully useful to others as to what worked for me.

## About my Radio Journey

I've been a licensed radio amateur in Canada since I was 13 years old. It was
my first exposure to radio and electronics technology, and the ham radio
license course I took at my local college really set me on a path of both
theory and practical learning that continues to this day. After obtaining my
Basic license, I got involved in the local ham radio scene in my town, met
other hams (mostly older than me) and even visited the Dayton Hamvention which
completely blew my mind.

My high school was a technical school that had an electronics department.
I took most of the courses offered which included electronics theory, analog and
digital electronics, my first introduction to C programming, and many related topics.
Computers and later the Internet would take my interest away from radio for quite
a while, but I always kept coming back to it over the years.

In 2017 after working in electronics and running my own business for a long time
I became interested in radio again and decided to upgrade my license to
Advanced. I took the test and passed with flying colours, but a move to another
city shortly after once again got in the way of the hobby.

In 2020 due to stay-at-home orders, etc. several local ham clubs started hosting
online meetings, so I decided to join and participate in the meetings. I made
some friends through the groups and started to get more interested in radio. I
am now focused on learning RF theory and design as a way to improve my skills
as an electronics designer.

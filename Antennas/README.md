# Antenna Projects

Antennas are interesting, although I am more keen to work on circuitry and
code related to radio rather than just antennas. However in my quest to set
up a useful station in a challenging space I have done quite a lot of research
into antennas and built a number of prototypes to test.

There are an infinite number of possibilities when it comes to antennas but
the main thing that I've learned is that you can't get something for nothing.
Anyone familiar with speaker cabinet design will be familiar with the types
of physical realities of size, bandwidth, efficiency and so on. These same
trade-offs also exist with antennas, however the number of possible
configurations and the incredible range of frequencies that can be explored
from kHz up to GHz is really quite fascinating.

# Antenna Projects

Antennas are interesting, although I am more keen to work on circuitry and
code related to radio rather than antennas. However in my quest to set up a
useful station in a challenging environment I have done quite a lot of research
into antennas and built a number of prototypes to test.

## Projects

- [Active Receiving Loop](ActiveReceivingLoop.md) - an (unsuccesful) attempt at making a small and effective SWL antenna based on a popular concept
- [End-Fed Half Wave](EndFedHalfWave.md) - various experiments with end-fed half-wave antenna and ununs
- [NOAA Weather Satellite V-Dipole](NOAAWeatherDipole.md) - my version of a very simple dipole antenna for receiving weather satellite images
- [2m / 70cm J-Pole](2m70cmJPole.md) - a decent dual-band 2m / 70cm J-Pole antenna made from copper tubing

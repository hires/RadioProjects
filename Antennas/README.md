# Antenna Projects

Antennas are interesting, although I am more keen to work on circuitry and
code related to radio rather than just antennas. However in my quest to set
up a useful station in a challenging space I have done quite a lot of research
into antennas and built a number of prototypes to test.

There are an infinite number of possibilities when it comes to antennas but
the main thing that I've learned is that you can't get something for nothing.
Anyone familiar with speaker cabinet design will be familiar with the trade-offs
which come with the various driver type, box size, and so on. These types of
physical limitations also apply to antenna design, however the sheer variety
sizes, shapes and features are quite astounding.
